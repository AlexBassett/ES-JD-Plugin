			`As you enter the system, something unusual stands out to you, there is a strangely shaped object in slow orbit around the black hole. This is exceedingly rare, as very few things survive the crushing gravity, you feel you should probably find out what it is. `

					goto approach

			` You go over the object with your sensors, which indicate that it is emitting an extremely faint signal, undetectable unless directly seaching for it.`
			`The signal plays out as a form of garbled speech and static. Completely incomprehensible and definitely not human, this message repeats after about 5 minutes of nonsense.`
			choice 
				`(Approach it)`

			label approach
			`As you approach it, you notice the unmistakable glint of a starship hull. Covered in layers of caked-on grime, this ship looks like its been still for hundreds of years.`
			`The design is unfamiliar to you, and looks like nothing you've ever seen in Human or Alien space.`
			`You are unsure how to proceed with this, the ship looks abandoned.`
			choice
				`(Hail the ship)`

			`You hail the ship, but there is no response. Boarding it is the best possible option.`
			`"The Remnant would love to get their hands on such unique technology" you think, "They'd probably pay millions for it."`
