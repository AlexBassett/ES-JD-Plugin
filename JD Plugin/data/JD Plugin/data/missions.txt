		dialog "Surpisingly, as you blast through the airlock, you are only met with freshly recycled air, not the vacuum you prepared for. The ship has some form of in-built life support, which explains how it stayed mostly intact in orbit around the black hole. What concerns you is how there is no evidence of any crew anywhere in the ship, just a thick layer of dust over all the floors and controls. Once you reach the engine room, you find an unfamiliar sight, an odd, red Jump Drive. This seems very old, maybe you should take it to someone with expertise in salvaging alien artifacts. "

			`As you enter the system, something unusual stands out to you, there is a strangely shaped object in slow orbit around the black hole. This is exceedingly rare, as very few things survive the crushing gravity, you feel you should probably find out what it is. `

			` You go over the object with your sensors, which indicate that it is emitting an extremely faint signal, undetectable unless directly seaching for it.`
			`The signal plays out as a form of garbled speech and static. Completely incomprehensible and definitely not human, this message repeats after about 5 minutes of nonsense.`

			`As you approach it, you notice the unmistakable glint of a starship hull. Covered in layers of caked-on grime, this ship looks like its been still for hundreds of years.`
			`The design is unfamiliar to you, and looks like nothing you've ever seen in Human or Alien space.`
			`You are unsure how to proceed with this, the ship looks abandoned.`
