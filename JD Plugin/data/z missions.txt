conversation "board derelict"
	`Surpisingly, as blast through the airlock, you are only met with freshly recycled air, not the vacuum you prepared for. The ship has some form of in-built life support, which explains how it stayed mostly intact in orbit around the black hole. What concerns you is how there is no evidence of any crew anywhere in the ship, just a thick layer of dust over all the floors and controls. Once you reach the engine room, you find an unfamiliar sight, an odd, red Jump Drive. This seems very old, maybe you should take it to someone with expertise in salvaging alien artifacts. `
